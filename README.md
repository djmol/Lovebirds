Draw paths to guide your heart to the end!

### Features implemented
* Heart coin pickups - They spawn additional bonus hearts (same physics, but smaller, faster, and expendable).
* Pink pickups - They restore draw resource.
* Bumper obstacles - Avoid them, or use them to your advantage!
* Randomly generated cloud-pattern background - ...So I don't have to manually place clouds.

#### "This project doesn't compile!"
This project uses BG Curve, LeanTween, and the Unity Post-Processing Stack, all of which were obtained for free and installed via the Unity Asset Store.
